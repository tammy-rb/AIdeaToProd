convert the response from the first step into a Pydantic BaseModel types.
make a file that it will be saved there - so we will not need to run it multiple times.

lots of money!
so please run all of it just when i need.
run the next steps independently. 
enter the inputs manually.

first step is complete, only need parsing.
the final agent will store in a pre- made file the result fields we need

next agent will use the content of the file.
or we will parse it to the next agent.
