## üìÅ Available Resources

### `gdrive://recent-files`
Provides access to the 20 most recently modified files in your Google Drive. Useful for quick access to files you've been working on.

## üîç File ID Reference

Google Drive file IDs are long alphanumeric strings that uniquely identify files. You can find them:

1. **From `list_drive_files` results** - Look for the `id` field
2. **From Google Drive URLs** - The part between `/d/` and `/edit`
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/document/d/FILE_ID_HERE/edit
   ```
3. **From search results** - The `id` field in search responses

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Permissions

- The server only accesses files you have permission to view
- OAuth2 ensures secure authentication
- Credentials are stored locally and encrypted
- The server respects Google Drive sharing permissions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure `credentials/gcp-oauth.keys.json` is properly configured
- Check that Google Drive API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
- Verify OAuth consent screen is configured

### File Access Issues  
- Confirm you have permission to access the file
- Check that the file hasn't been deleted or moved
- Verify the file ID is correct

### Large File Handling
- Files over 5MB may have slower response times
- Consider pagination for large file lists
- Binary files are base64-encoded which increases size
