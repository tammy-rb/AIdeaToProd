# Detailed Design Document: WordLengthChecker

## APP_META
- **App Name**: WordLengthChecker
- **Description**: An application that the user enters a word, and it returns the number of letters in that word.

## Architecture & Environments
- **Architecture**: Microservices-based architecture for scalability.
- **Environments**: Development, Testing, and Production.

## Data Model (Detailed)
- **Input Data**: Word (String)
- **Output Data**: Length of the word (Integer)

## APIs/Contracts (Detailed)
- **Input API**: `POST /word`
  - **Request Body**: `{ "word": "<input_word>" }`
  - **Response**: `{ "length": <word_length> }`
- **Output API**: `GET /length`
  - **Response**: `{ "length": <word_length> }`

## Workflows & Sequences
1. User inputs a word via the interface.
2. Word is sent to the Length Calculator API.
3. API processes the input and returns the word length.
4. Result is displayed to the user.

## Security & Privacy Controls
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- HTTPS for secure data transmission.

## Observability
- Implement logging for all API requests and responses.
- Monitoring for performance metrics of the Length Calculator service.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit Testing for input and output handling.
- Integration Testing for API contracts.
- User Acceptance Testing to ensure usability requirements are met.

## Delivery Plan
- Development Phase: 2 weeks
- Testing Phase: 1 week
- Deployment Phase: 1 week
