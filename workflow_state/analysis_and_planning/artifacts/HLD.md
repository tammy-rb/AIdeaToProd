# High-Level Design Document: WordLengthChecker

## APP_META
- **App Name**: WordLengthChecker
- **Idea**: An application that the user enters a word, and it returns the number of letters in that word.

## Problem & Goals
- **Problem**: Users need an efficient way to find out the length of a word without manual counting.
- **Goals**: Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting a word and receiving quick feedback on the number of letters.

## Personas & Top User Stories
- **Persona**: Casual users who frequently engage with word games.
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to type a word and see its length instantly so that I can use it for my game.

## System Context
- The application will take input from users via text fields and provide output in the form of length, displayed prominently.

## Major Components & Responsibilities
1. **Input Handler**: Captures user input for the word.
2. **Length Calculator**: Processes the input and calculates the length of the word.
3. **Output Display**: Presents the calculated length to the user in a clear format.

## High-Level Data Model
- **Input**: User word (String)
- **Output**: Word length (Integer)

## Interfaces/APIs (High-Level)
- Input API: `POST /word` (for submitting the word)
- Output API: `GET /length` (for fetching the length response)

## NFRs
- Performance: The application should return results within 200ms.
- Usability: Simple interface with minimum steps for users.
- Reliability: The application should handle edge cases like empty inputs gracefully.

## Risks & Assumptions
- **Risk**: Users might input non-alphabetic characters.
- **Assumption**: Users will primarily input valid words.
